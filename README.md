# Datepicker UI

## Description
Datepicker UI is a simple, static datepicker component created using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a foundational UI element for selecting dates and can later be enhanced with JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality. The current version is non-functional and designed for demonstration purposes, making it an ideal starting point for learning UI development.

This project is based on the task described on [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui). It is meant to familiarize developers with designing user interfaces using basic web technologies without relying on JavaScript.

### Features:
- Simple, visually appealing calendar UI.
- Custom date input field for `dd/mm/yyyy`.
- Clean layout with a responsive design.
- Navigation buttons for switching months (static for now).
- Hover effects on date cells to enhance user experience.
